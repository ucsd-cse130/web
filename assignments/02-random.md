## Due by 11:59 pm on Monday, May 1st, 2017.

**NOTE:** To get the code provided for problem 2 to work on Windows/Mac
please [install ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
Remember that this is only to enable you to play with the assignment at home.

## Overview

The objective of this assignment is for you to have fun learning
about recursion, recursive datatypes, and make some pretty
cool pictures.All the problems require relatively little
code ranging from 2 to 10 lines. If any function requires
more than that, you can be sure that you need to rethink
your solution.

The assignment is in the single file

- [hw2.ml](/static/raw/hw2.ml)

that you need to download, if you wish, by using `wget`:

```bash
$ wget https://ucsd-cse130.github.io/web/static/raw/hw2.ml
```

The file contains:

1. **skeleton functions** with missing bodies that you will fill in,
2. **sample tests**, and,
3. **testing code** that you will use to check your assignments before submitting.

As before, your task is to replace each expression of the form

~~~~~{.ocaml}
failwith "to be written"
~~~~~

with the the appropriate OCaml code for each of those expressions.

**Note:** All the solutions can be done using the purely
functional fragment of OCaml, using constructs covered
in class, and most require the use of **recursion**.
Solutions using imperative features such as references,
while loops or library functions will receive **no credit**
It is a good idea to start this assignment early; ML
programming, while quite simple (when you know how),
often seems somewhat foreign at first, particularly
when it comes to recursion and list manipulation.


## Assignment Testing and Evaluation

Your functions/programs **must** compile and run with `ocaml` on `ieng6.ucsd.edu`.

Most of the points, will be awarded automatically, by
**evaluating your functions against a given test suite**.
[hw1.ml](/static/raw/hw1.ml) contains a very small suite
of tests which gives you a flavor of of these tests.

At any point, on the bash shell, enter:

```ocaml
$ ocaml hw2.ml
```

or if you are in the Ocaml REPL enter:

```ocaml
# #use "hw2.ml" ;;
```

to get a report on how your code stacks
up against the simple tests.

The last line of the shell must look like:

~~~~~
130>>Compiled

- : int * int = (SCORE, TOTAL)
~~~~~

where `SCORE` and `TOTAL` are a pair of integers,
reflecting your score and the max possible score
on the sample tests.

**If instead an error message appears, your code will receive a zero.**

If for some problem, you cannot get the code to compile, leave it as is with
the `failwith ...` with your partial solution enclosed below as a comment.

The other lines will give you a readout for each test. You are encouraged to
try to understand the testing code, but you will not be graded on this.

## Submission Instructions

To submit your homework (on `ieng6`), enter:

```bash
$ tar -zcvf hw2.tgz *.ml *.jpg *.png
$ turnin -c cs130s -p 02 hw2.tgz
```

`turnin` will provide you with a confirmation of the
submission process; make sure that the size of the file
indicated by `turnin` matches the size of your file.
See the ACS Web page on [turnin](http://acs.ucsd.edu/info/turnin.php)
for more information on the operation of the program.


## Problem #1: Tail Recursion

We say that a function is *tail recursive* if
every recursive call is a [tail call](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) whose value is immediately
returned by the procedure. See
[these](/static/tailrecursion.txt)
[two](/static/tailrecursion.pdf)
handouts for more details on what a
tail-recursive function is in Ocaml.

### (a) 15 points

Without using any built-in ML functions, write a
*tail-recursive* Ocaml function

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val assoc : int * string * (string * int) list -> int
~~~~~

or more generally,

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val assoc : 'a * 'b * ('b * 'a) list -> 'a
~~~~~

that takes a triple `(v, k, [(k1,v1);...;(kn,vn)])`
and finds the first `ki` that equals `k`.
If such a `ki` is found, then the function should return `vi`,
otherwise, the default value `v` is returned.

Once you have implemented the function, you should get
the following behavior at the ML prompt:

~~~~~{.ocaml}
# assoc (-1,"william",[("ranjit",85);("william",23);("moose",44)]);;    
- : int = 23

# assoc (-1,"bob",[("ranjit",85);("william",23);("moose",44)]);;
- : int = -1
~~~~~

### (b) 15 points

Without using any built-in ML functions,
**modify the skeleton** for `removeDuplicates`
to obtain a function of type

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val removeDuplicates : int list -> int list
~~~~~

or more generally,

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val removeDuplicates : 'a list -> 'a list
~~~~~

such that `removeDuplicates xs` returns the list
of elements of `xs` with the duplicates, i.e.
second, third, etc. occurrences, removed, and
where the remaining elements appear in the same
order as in `xs`.

For this function only, you may use the library
functions `List.rev` and `List.mem`. Once you have
implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the ML prompt:

~~~~~{.ocaml}
# removeDuplicates [1;6;2;4;12;2;13;6;9];;
- : int list = [1;6;2;4;12;13;9]
~~~~~

### (c) 20 points

Without using any built-in ML functions, or the `while`
or `for` construct, write a tail-recursive ML function:

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val wwhile : (int -> int * bool) * int -> int
~~~~~

or more generally,

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val wwhile : ('a -> 'a * bool) * 'a -> 'a
~~~~~

such that `wwhile (f, x)` returns `x'` where there exist values
`v_0`,...,`v_n` such that

- `x` is equal to `v_0`
- `x'` is equal to `v_n`
- for each `i` between `0` and `n-2`, we have `f v_i` equals `(v_i+1, true)`
- `f v_n-1` equals `(v_n, false)`.

Your function should be tail recursive.
Once you have implemented the function,
you should get the following behavior at
the ML prompt:

~~~~~{.ocaml}    
# let f x = let xx = x*x*x in (xx, xx < 100) in wwhile (f,2);;
- : int = 512
~~~~~

### (d) 20 points

Without using any built-in ML functions,
**modify the skeleton** for  `fixpoint`
to obtain a function

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val fixpoint: (int -> int) * int -> int
~~~~~

or more generally,

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val fixpoint: ('a -> 'a) * 'a -> 'a
~~~~~

such that `fixpoint (f, x0)` returns the first `xi` where

- `xi` is equal tyo `f x_i-1`, and, furthermore,
- `f xi` is equal to `xi`


Once you have implemented the function, you should get the
following behavior at the ML prompt:

~~~~~{.ocaml}
# let g x = truncate (1e6 *. cos (1e-6 *. float x));;
val f : int -> int = fn

# fixpoint (g, 0);;
- : int = 739085

# let collatz n = match n with 1 -> 1 | _ when n mod 2 = 0 -> n/2 | _ -> 3*n + 1;;
val collatz: int -> int = fn

# fixpoint (collatz, 1) ;;
- : int = 1
# fixpoint (collatz, 3) ;;
- : int = 1
# fixpoint (collatz, 48) ;;
- : int = 1
# fixpoint (collatz, 107) ;;
- : int = 1
# fixpoint (collatz, 9001) ;;
- : int = 1
~~~~~

## Problem #2: Random Art
At the end of this assignment, you should be able to produce
pictures of the kind shown below. To do so, we shall devise a
grammar for a certain class of expressions, design an ML
datatype whose values correspond to such expressions, write
code to evaluate the expressions, and then write a function
that randomly generates such expressions and plots them thus
producing random psychedelic art.

**Color Images**

**Gray Scale Images**

### (a) 15 points

The expressions described by the grammar:

~~~~~{.ocaml}
e ::= x
    | y
    | sin (pi*e)
    | cos (pi*e)
    | ((e + e)/2)
    | e * e
    | (e<e ? e : e)
~~~~~

where pi stands for the constant 3.142, are functions over the variables
x,y, which are guaranteed to produce a value in the range [-1,1] when x and
y are in that range. We can represent expressions of this grammar in ML
using values of the following datatype:

~~~~~{.ocaml}  
type expr = VarX
          | VarY
          | Sine of expr
          | Cosine of expr
          | Average of expr * expr
          | Times of expr * expr
          | Thresh of expr * expr * expr * expr
~~~~~

First, write a function

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val exprToString : expr -> string
~~~~~

to enable the printing of expressions. Once you have implemented
the function, you should get the following behavior at the ML prompt:

~~~~~{.ocaml}
# let sampleExpr1 = Thresh(VarX,VarY,VarX,(Times(Sine(VarX),Cosine(Average(VarX,VarY)))));;
- : expr =  ...

# exprToString sampleExpr1
- : string = "(x<y?x:sin(pi*x)*cos(pi*((x+y)/2)))"
~~~~~

### (b) 15 points

Next, write a function

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val eval : expr * float * float -> float
~~~~~

such that `eval (e, vx, vy)` returns the result of evaluating
the expression `e` at the point `(vx, vy)` that is, evaluating
the result of `e` when `VarX` has the value `vx` and `VarY` has
the value `vy`. You should use Ocaml functions like,
`sin`, and `cos` to build your evaluator. Recall that
`Sine(VarX)` corresponds to the expression `sin(pi*x)`

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the
following behavior at the ML prompt:

~~~~~{.ocaml}
# eval (Sine(Average(VarX,VarY)),0.5,-0.5);;
- : float = 0.0

# eval (Sine(Average(VarX,VarY)),0.3,0.3);;
- : float = 0.809016994375

# eval (sampleExpr,0.5,0.2);;
- : float = 0.118612572815
~~~~~

Uncomment and execute the line:

~~~~~{.ocaml}
let _ = emitGrayscale (eval_fn sampleExpr, 150, "sample") ;;
~~~~~

to generate the grayscale image `art_g_sample.jpg` in your working
directory. To receive full credit, this image must look like the
leftmost grayscale image displayed above. Note that this requires
your implementation `eval` to work correctly. A message `Uncaught
exception ...` is an indication that your `eval` is returning a value
outside the valid range `[-1.0,1.0]`.

### (c) 20 points
Next, you must fill in an implementation for the function

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val build: ((int * int -> int) * int) -> expr
~~~~~

The function `build` is called with the pair of arguments `(rand, depth)`.

- `rand` is a random number generator of type `int * int -> int`.
   Each call `rand (i,j)` returns a random integer between `i` and `j`
   inclusive. Use this function to randomly select operators when
   composing subexpressions to build up larger expressions.

- `depth` is a a maximum nesting dept; a random expression of depth `d` is
  built by randomly composing  sub-expressions of depth `d-1` and the
  only expressions of depth `0` are `VarX` and `VarY`.


With this in place you can generate random art using the functions

~~~~~{.ocaml}
val doRandomGray : int * int * int -> unit
val doRandomColor : int * int * int -> unit
~~~~~

Each function takes as a parameter a triple `(depth, seed1, seed2)`
where `depth` is the depth of the expression to be generated and
`seed1`, `seed2` are two seeds for the random number generator.
The functions generate JPEG files called
`art_g_<depth>_<seed1>_<seed2>.jpg` and
`art_c_<depth>_<seed1>_<seed2>.jpg` respectively.
The first is a gray scale image, built by mapping out a single
randomly generated expression over the plane, and the second is
a color image built using three functions for the intensities of
red, green and blue.

Play around with how you generate the expressions, using the
tips below.

- Depths of 8-12 produce interesting pictures, but play around!
- Make sure your expressions don't get *cut-off* early with
  `VarX`, `VarY` as small expressions give simple pictures.
- Play around to bias the generation towards more interesting operators.

Save the parameters (i.e. the depth and the seeds)
for your best three color images in the bodies of
`c1`, `c2`, `c3` respectively, and best three gray
images in `g1`, `g2` , `g3`.

### (d) 20 points
Finally, add **two** new operators to the grammar, i.e. to the
datatype, by introducing two new datatype constructors, and adding the
corresponding cases to `exprToString`, `eval`, and `build`.
The only requirements are that the operators must return
values in the range `[-1.0,1.0]` if their arguments (ie `VarX` and `VarY`)
are in that range, and that one of the operators take **three**
arguments, i.e. one of the datatype constructors is of the form:
`C of expr * expr * expr`
You can include images generated with these new operators
when choosing your best images for part (c).
